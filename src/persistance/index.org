* Object Model
  
  Here we decide the database model (table and the relations ) for the application

** Table

   We have two table in the database : User and Role

*** Role table:

    We have two roles admin and user. So this table has two entries : one for
    admin and one for user and not changed throughout.

*** User table

    This table maintains one entry per user in the database. It has name,
    email id and a reference to the corresponding entry to the role table
    corresponding if the user is admin or a normal user.
