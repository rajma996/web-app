* Introduction
  
  Through the course of this project, we need to build a web
  application, ground up to the cloud.  We need to go through an
  end-to-end requirements.

* Goal
  
  Gathering the requirements

** Requirements gathering
   We need to document the requirements of the user/customer. These
   need to be established as early as possible, so as to ensure that
   the end application is what the customer wants.
   
* Components of a web application

** Front-end component
   We need to build the front-end of the application, which will be
   the interface for the user to interact with the application. The
   front-end is essentially the interface between the user and the
   server.
   
** Server-side component
   The server-side component will service the requests from the
   front-end user component. This component ensures that whatever
   data the front-end component requests will be serviced accurately
   and as soon as possible, from the database.

* List of technologies
  - [[https://www.python.org][Python]] :: Python will be the main language in the implementation
              of this project.  We will be using version 2.7.  (Not
              3.x).

  - [[https://flask.pocoo.org/][Flask]] :: Flask is the framework for web development in Python.  
             We will use version 0.10.1.
